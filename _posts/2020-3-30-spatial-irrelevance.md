title: Renters are paying for a location that is not worth what it was at the time the lease was signed.
---

People pay a lot to live in a Medford building not because the buildings are of superior quality, but because of their locations. The value people ascribe to access to a location for a period of time we call "ground rent." We associate this with land value. 

(Aside: I should perhaps pause and say that this isn't 100% true because restrictions on building allow apartment-owners to increase the rent further than land values alone would indicate. This kind of rent is a form of economic rent similar to that rent that a taxi medallion owner extracts or the kind that doctors enjoy because of unnecessary restrictions on what registered nurses can do.)

Ground rent is a component of the house-rent that we pay to our our apartment-lords each month; it's that part of the house-rent we are willing to pay ONLY because of the apartment's good location.

(Aside: other parts of the house-rent include payment for use of the improvements, maintenance of improvements, tax on improvements, and included utilities such as water and sewage. Note that tax on the land is *not* a separate component of the house-rent -- land tax is a component of the ground rent that happens to be forwarded to the city rather than kept by the landlord. That's because taxes on land don't make land scarce.)

## Ground rent is what makes Medford housing expensive

President Falco understands this point. In his Jan. 14 resolution to "develop and establish an Affordable Housing Trust," he justified the resolution thus:

> Whereas the City of Medford is only 5 miles north of Boston and is a very desirable place to live

He of course doesn't believe that it's marble countertops, stainless steel fixtures, or double-glazed windows that make housing in Medford expensive. He knows that it's a thirst for a good location. Since very few communities in this country are navigable without a car, everybody interested in that lifestyle has to compete for locations in just a few communities, for example.

## COVID-19 screws up location

Entertainment venues and many workplaces are closed. Though the city of Medford is still five miles north of Boston, it might as well be a few galaxies away for many of our residents.

Locations and distances only really matter once someone decides to traverse them. When destinations in the city are closed, and when we are advised to avoid public transportation, we might as well live in Vermont.

It's clear to me that real short-term ground rents in Medford has plummeted during the pandemic as the location advantages of our apartments fade away. Access to this land is only a bit better than the land in Vermont.

## Leases as bets

The customary 12-month lease is basically a bet that, over the next 12 months, the house-rent will stay at least at the level it was when the lease was signed.

Some of the advantages that a tenant enjoys are financial: proximity to well-paying jobs, access to sidewalks and public transit that obviate the need for a car, etc. When the location advantage dries up due to the economy crashing, war breaking out, or COVID-19 chasing everyone into their homes, the financial advantages simply dry up and the tenant might not be able to afford the previous rent.

And, more importantly, it's possible that *no* tenant would be willing to pay the contract rent specified in the lease! It's unlikely that, in the event of an eviction, the landlord could fill the apartment with a new tenant willing to pay what the old tenant agreed to.

It's important at this point that I stress that ground rent is only *relative,* not absolute. We'd be hard-pressed to say that any slice of Earth is useless, but we can quite reasonably say that land of a particular usefulness commands zero ground rent because it is so plentiful that some of it is left unused even if the ground rent is put down to zero and any who want to use it are free to do so. 

## Ownership as lease

When someone buys land, the *price* is based on all the future ground rents the owner expects to be able to keep. That is the total ground rent, less the taxes that will be due on the land.

The land deed is, in effect a lease of infinite term, with all the excess rents (in excess of taxes) paid up-front. Future rents are of course discounted to account for the time-value of money and we can arrive at a finite price. 

The buyer is effectively betting that excess ground rents will meet his expectations.

## Mortgage as ticking time-bombs

Since few have enough cash on hand to pay up ground-rents till the end of time, they tend to take out 30-year mortgages to pay in installments.

The mortgage allows them to pay off the incumbent landlowner not with their own money, but a bank's money.

The bank is betting that things will go for both the land and the owner. In the event something goes wrong, they can take the land for themselves.

This can work quite well in the case of an issue with the owner. But if the issue is with a temporary problem associated with the land itself, the bank is unlikely to be able to put it to good use for quite some time. 

## The purpose of ground rent

Ground rent itself is not an evil thing.

Ground rent arises from the need to allocate scarce land efficiently. The idea is that if you want a better location, you can choose to pay a higher ground rent. Putting down the ground rent will not make good locations any less scarce.

The market's job, though, should always to allocate scarce economic resources. 

## Risk

The tool we give landlords and lenders to enforce their contract would, in times of general economic hardship, would have extremely negative societal consequences.

FIRST, all the shuffling around will spread the virus.

SECOND, too many of the properties will ultimately sit empty, meaning that the market will have failed to allocate the scarce economic resources to anyone!

Lenders and landlords, if you ask them, would say that their profits (in excess of expenses, labor, and opportunity cost) in good times are to compensate them for risk.

Well, risk that ground rents drop precipitously while eviction and foreclosure would be patently anti-social behaviors has to be one of the risks that landlords and lenders took on.

## De-financialization

Ultimately, the way forward has to be to eliminate the price stickiness of mortgage payments, by reducing the mortgages on land.

The way to do that is to increase the taxes on land to take more of the ground rent. This will drive down prices.

The landowner, in his role as landowner, neither creates the location nor makes the location desirable. Since we do not depend on anyone to make the land, we do not need anyone in particular to keep the ground rent.

The usual argument for a land value tax is it prevents land speculation. And this is quite true, and this point will be made in future blog posts. 

But socializing the ground rent in this way also socializes risk, both upside and downside. Rather than landowners taking a hit when the ground rents go down, and living high on the hog when land ground rents go up, a high land value tax allows the uncertainty to be born by government budgets rather than household budgets.
