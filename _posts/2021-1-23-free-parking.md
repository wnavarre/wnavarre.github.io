title: When we assume parking must be free, that has consequences
---

There is no such thing as free parking in the city.

It is often pointed out that you are paying for parking through your taxes, or through your rent, or through the price at the grocer.

That all may be true, but there's a more fundamental way that *someone* is paying for parking: opportunity cost.

Every square foot of urban land dedicated to parking could be used for something else, such as housing, businesses, or greenspace.

Before the pandemic, Medford residents had been facing a housing crisis, a traffic crisis, and a global climate crisis. I think it is worth examining how the assumption that parking must be free worsens all three crises.

## Love me, love my car

Whenever new housing development is proposed, neighbors take a keen interest in where their new neighbors will store their automobiles.

There is an assumption implicit in this concern -- namely, that the new residents will have cars.

Medford is a very special place, as it seems that a fair number of people here in Medford are car-free (or sufficiently car-lite that they might be able to give up their car given the right incentives), and a great many others insist going car-free is impossible.

Whatever the case may be, when we assume that parking must be free to all drivers, we are making ZERO effort to try to select for those residents who, for whatever reason, won't be bringing a car with them to park on already-crowded street. For those who do plan to use a car, they take a "love me, love my car" attitude.

Neighbors begin to fear their future neighbors who might be afflicted with this attitude, which is why we have "parking minimums." 

## We treat cars like a bodily function, and we begin to hate people

Just the other day I was arguing with someone who was describing the horror of overcrowded apartments in a neighborhood. She said that overcrowded apartments leads to extra contention on the street, and neighbors hate it!
