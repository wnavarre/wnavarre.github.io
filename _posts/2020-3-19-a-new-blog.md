title: A blog of rants, local politics, and fundamental change
---

Now will perhaps reveal itself to have been the worst time to start a blog of any kind. Perhaps the market will be beyond saturated with blogs from those who, cooped up in their homes to try to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, start a blog. 

More morbidly, COVID-19 may well reveal itself to be such an awful tragedy that forging ahead on political change beyond it will come to be seen as being in poor taste.

Nevertheless, I keep on.

## Justification for blog sought

And I suspect a great number of the blogs will open with an explanation justifying their existence, and most explanations will be suspiciously more glamorous than a simple exposition on the author's need to distract himself from drinking too much chocolate milk during social distancing.

Suspicion notwithstanding, I endeavor to explain.

## Justification pondered

I have adopted the practice of attending weekly city council meetings in my city of Medford whenever I can.

I attend them mainly for the purpose of promoting more intensive land use so that more Americans can enjoy urban life without the need for a dangerous, expensive, cumbersome, and polluting personal automobile! 

I have voiced my support for abolishing parking minimums, for legalizing multi-story technologies such as triple-deckers to fit more residents on the same lot, and most of all, I've voiced my support for a land value tax that stops taxing improvements and taxes land at a higher rate. This topic will doubtless be a major focus in this blog. 

I have in my time attending Council meetings even defended the oft-maligned property tax as being far better than the other taxes that our government levies upon us (though not as good as a land value tax, of course!).

### Shall

But last Council meeting (just nine days ago, when life was normal and we were oblivious to how severely this virus would effect our daily lives), it came to my attention that there was a change to city code that used the word "shall" instead of "must."

I don't remember when I learned to hate "shall" in legalese. But if memory serves, it was after some terribly stupid argument that took place in the MIT Undergraduate Association.

### MIT Student Government, Li'l B, and Legalese

UA Council was trying to refer the president to the Judicial Committee for impeachment over the Li'l B scandal (don't ask!). One problem: that committee only had one member, and three were needed for a quorum. The vacancies were caused by the same president's failure to fulfill her responsibility to nominate someone to the committee. I believe the word "shall" was used in the constitution to designate that the president was supposed to put forth those nominations, and there was some big argument over whether she had failed to fulfill a constitional obligation. With no good way to give the president an impartial trial, it was effectively a constitutional crisis!

I remember looking up "shall" and finding that there was actually a lot of discussion about how ["shall" was to be avoided: the legal reference "Words and Phrases" have 76 pages on cases interpreting the word](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/shall-and-must/)!

And so I got up and suggested they change the wording.

Of course, I was not articulate or funny when I got up there. I was just sort of reading from [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/use-must-to-indicate-requirements/), probably mumbling a bit, and it wasn't interesting to anyone and, alas, it didn't inspire any amendments. 

## Lame justification put forth, hazarding public ridicule

So, I guess, that's why I need this blog. Perhaps if I have this blog, I can put such musings here and send the councilors a link afterwards. After all, they probably would have wanted to go home a bit earlier Tuesday, but some of them might well be sitting home now -- perhaps at this point some of them might find a discussion of "shall" interesting.  

I can also use this space to write about my vision for fundamental reform.
