<p>tl.dr: THIS WEDNESDAY! Tell CDB you favor a zoning code that will allow Medford to welcome more neighbors! Log on to Zoom at 6:30 p.m. this Wednesday, May 21. [!!SEND YOUR WRITTEN COMMENT NOW IN CASE YOU MISS IT!!](mailto:ocd@medford-ma.gov?subject=Public%20comment%20re%3A%205%2F21%20NR%2FUR%20Upzoning%20CDB%20agenda%20item&body=My%20name%20and%20address%20for%20the%20record%3A%20%0A). If that link doesn't work, email ocd@medford-ma.gov and include name and address for the record. Mention "NR/UR Zoning public comment" in the subject line.</p>

<p>This is an urgent call to action so I don't have to spam you for weeks on end. :-)</p>

<p>This will be the third full meeting which the CDB has spent chiefly on Neighborhood and Urban Residential areas. This is a HUGE chunk of Medford's zoning map.</p>

<p>For folks who would like to see our zoning updated and reformed to allow for more housing in our community, this is your moment to ACT!</p>

<p>WE EXPECT SOME OPPOSITION FROM NEIGHBORS ALARMED AT THE IDEA THAT MORE PEOPLE MIGHT MOVE INTO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. A great many people are surprised to learn that some of their neighbors are enthusiastic about more apartments going up. Please show up and make your voice heard! And <a href="mailto:ocd@medford-ma.gov?subject=Public%20comment%20re%3A%205%2F21%20NR%2FUR%20Upzoning%20CDB%20agenda%20item&body=My%20name%20and%20address%20for%20the%20record%3A%20%0A">EMAIL RIGHT NOW</a> in case you can't make it!</p>

<p>Just to get you started and help you draft that email RIGHT THIS MINUTE...</p>

<h2>General talking points</h2>
<ul>
<li>    "I support this proposal for updating the zoning and adding more housing to my neighborhood and throughout the City."</li>

<li>    "We urgently need to increase our housing potential in Medford. This zoning proposal is an important step in the right direction, and I support it.”</li>

<li>    “These zoning changes will mean that more housing types are allowed, which means property owners have more choices for what to do with their private property. I support giving property owners more choice.”</li>

<li>    “These zoning changes will help us start to meet the needs of existing Medford residents. These zoning changes will allow us to add more of different types of housing, like smaller rental units and smaller condos. Having more of these different types of housing in Medford will allow people in the community to downsize while remaining in this community. There are many longtime Medford residents who want to be able to downsize and age in place in Medford, but there aren’t enough good options that allow them to do that, so they get pushed out.”</li>

<li>    “I understand that people are more interested in living in an urban neighborhood today than they were 30 years ago, and I’m glad about that since it’s a relatively painless way to address a lot of environmental concerns. I am OK if that means that neighborhoods look different.”</li>

<li>    “Building housing closer to the city creates opportunities for people to drive less.”</li>

<li>    “Each neighborhood and area of Medford needs updated zoning rules and this proposal allows for incremental change in each area of the City, not in a one-size-fits-all way but tailored to the different characteristics of each area. Please pass this zoning proposal and bring our residential zoning into the 21st century.”</li>

<li>    “We have a severe regional housing shortage, and displacement is already occurring. Zoning isn’t a silver bullet, but it is a necessary part of the solution. Let’s pass this zoning proposal and start taking matters into our own hands.”</li>

<li>    “There are tons of constraints on what will actually get built even if this zoning passes as-is: building costs, Building Code, dimensional requirements, parking requirements, what individual property owners care to do with their properties. That’s an argument for making our zoning code more permissive, not less – because regardless of how we change the zoning, actual changes to Medford’s landscape will likely happen incrementally, over the course of many years.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Go further!</h2>

<ul><li>    This proposal is good, but we should improve it by taking this opportunity to go even further. We should allow additional height and housing units by-right, especially in Urban Residential 2 districts, around T stops, and along all major corridors and Squares.”

  </li><li>

    This proposal moves us in the right direction, but I’m concerned that we are maintaining single family zoning in some parts of the city (albeit with ADUs).”

</li><li>

</ul>
<h2>As a resident of South Medford...</h2>
<li>
    “I support my area being zoned for UR1 or upzoned to UR2. Units like these shouldn’t be so scarce and competitive to live in. We should make it easier to create housing like mine that are right-sized, close to bus lines and T stops, close to parks and shops and amenities, and in walkable neighborhoods.”
</li><li>
    “I support my area being zoned for UR1 or upzoned to UR2. My neighborhood is awesome, I welcome having more neighbors, we have space for more neighbors.”
</li><li>

    “I think this proposal doesn’t go far enough. Why not zone this area for UR-2 or a higher-rise Mixed Use zone? We definitely have the space, people want more businesses around here, and more people want to live here than there is space for. I think this proposal doesn’t go far enough.”
</li><li>
</ul>
<h2>As a resident of West Medford...</h2>
<ul>
  <li>

    “I support allowing more density in West Medford because, not only will it help address the regional housing shortage, but it will also provide more neighbors to support a more vibrant business district that West Medford deserves.”
</li><li>
    “I enjoy living in this wonderful, walkable neighborhood with great small businesses and restaurants and access to the commuter rail station. Let’s update the zoning so more people can enjoy this excellent and well-connected neighborhood.”
</li><li>

    “As a resident of ________ [neighborhood or street], I support this proposal, and I actually think we could be upzoned further. My neighborhood is wonderful, I welcome having more neighbors, and I believe we have space for more neighbors.”
</li><li>

    “As a resident of ______ [neighborhood or street], I think this proposal doesn’t go far enough. Why not zone this area for Urban Residential 2 or a higher-rise Mixed Use zone? It will help us support a thriving West Medford Square with fewer vacant businesses if we have more people living within walking distance of the Square.”
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Regarding the remaining single family (NR-1) and duplex (NR-2) areas...</h2>
<ul><li>
    “No neighborhood should be left out of the zoning updates. We should only leave out certain roads or areas if road/geographic conditions absolutely demand it.”
</li><li>
    “Duplexes are good, and needed. We should make them possible by upzoning NR1 areas to NR2 wherever we can.”
</li><li>

    “People don’t just want to move into the most urban parts of the City; many people want to live in North Medford, too. We should incrementally upzone North Medford so all areas of the City can welcome new neighbors.” I look forward to seeing you on Zoom on Wednesday and reading your public comment that you send ahead of that meeting just in case you don’t make it!
